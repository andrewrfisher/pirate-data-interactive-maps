# pirate-data-interactive-maps

Thank you for your interest in my work! This is a repo for my interactive maps containing pirate attacks over the last several years.  I created using Mapbox and leaflet to create these maps and my fellow group members scraped this data using Python (hence the name of our project, "Pyrates") from the ICC Commercial Crime Services report on Piracy. 

This repo contains a map with marker clusters to get a better representation of the number of attacks within a given region as well as a color coded filterable map to paint a better picture of the type of attacks that occur across the globe.

**disclaimer
This repo is only for "show", which is why there are only several commits. I have simply copy and pasted previous code into this repo for to showcase the work I have done.
