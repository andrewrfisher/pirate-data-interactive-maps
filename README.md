# pirate-data-interactive-maps

Thank you for your interest in my work! This is a repo for my interactive maps containing pirate attacks over the last several years.  I built these maps using Mapbox and Leaflet in JavaScript, and my fellow group members scraped this data with Python BeautifulSoup (hence the name of our project, "Pyrates") and gathered our data from the ICC Commercial Crime Services report on Piracy (https://www.icc-ccs.org/index.php/piracy-reporting-centre/live-piracy-report). 

This repo contains a map with marker clusters to get a better representation of the number of attacks within a given region as well as a color coded filterable map to paint a better picture of the type of attacks that occur across the globe.

**disclaimer
This repo is only for "show", which is why there are only several commits. I have simply copy and pasted previous code into this repo for to showcase the work I have done.
