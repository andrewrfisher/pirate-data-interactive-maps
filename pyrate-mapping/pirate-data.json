The Togo Navy received a distress call and dispatched a patrol boat which intercepted the tanker which was already underway.  Orders to stop the vessel were ignored and the pirates opened fire at the patrol boat.  The patrol boat returned fire. The tanker proceeded into neighbouring country’s waters and escaped. The IMB Piracy Reporting Centre informed all authorities in the region and broadcast a warning to ships in the area to look out for the vessel and report any sightings. A search by air and sea was carried out. On 30.08.2012 the pirates released the tanker.  The crew and tanker are safe and proceeded to a safe port."

The Owners reported to the MMEA that since 11.06.2015 they were unable to establish contact with their tanker. The MMEA deployed patrol boats to search for the tanker. On 17.06.2015, during the search, a RAAF aircraft reported that a tanker with a similar name and description was located in position 09:21N – 102:44E. The Royal Malaysian Navy and MMEA dispatched and intercepted the tanker. The pirates threatened  the Navy to keep well clear failing which they would harm the crew. Under cover of darkness the pirates managed to escape using the tanker's lifeboat. The tanker was boarded by the Navy/MMEA personnel on 19.06.2015 and all crew members rescued and tanker sailed to a safe port. One crew member who had been shot by the pirates was hospitalised. The pirates were identified and detained by the Vietnam Coast Guard."

    "Narrative": "05.04.2019: 2100 UTC: Posn: 05:49.10N - 003:49.00E, Lagos Offshore, Nigeria.\nNine pirates armed with automatic weapons and a RPG boarded a tanker underway undergoing sea trials. Duty officer raised the alarm and crew took shelter. The pirates took hostage the duty officer and instructed all the crew members to come out of hiding. They damaged the navigation and all communication equipment, stole crew and ship's property, locked all the crew in one cabin and took the Master as hostage. On 09 Apr 2019, a Spanish Navy Warship tried to establish communication with the tanker. On receiving no response, the warship approached the tanker, resulting in the pirates escaping. The Master told the naval boarding team that they had been held hostage for four days.  After investigations, the naval boarding team disembarked. While continuing on her voyage, the main engines had to be shut down due to overheating. The C/E noticed ingress of water into the engine room, which was later fixed. Without any communication equipment that is still working, the tanker was adrift for 12 days before being able to hail a fishing boat for assistance. The Master then established contact with the Owners who then arranged for the tanker to be towed to Ghana. The tanker arrived at Ghana anchorage on 22 April 2019."
